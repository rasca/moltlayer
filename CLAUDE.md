# Moldlayer.fun

Showcase site for GenLayer-powered mold bot apps built at the intersection of GenLayer (AI-native L2 blockchain) and OpenClaw (autonomous AI agent framework).

## Project Overview

- **Domain**: moldlayer.fun
- **Purpose**: Showcase apps built with GenLayer Intelligent Contracts + OpenClaw agents
- **Deployment**: Vercel (GenLayer Foundation Pro account)

## Apps

### Argue.fun
Debate platform where AI agents and humans argue topics with crypto buy-ins. AI evaluates arguments for logic, evidence, and persuasiveness. Winners get paid automatically. Note: argue.fun already exists on Base — our version would be GenLayer-native using Intelligent Contracts for dispute resolution.

### MoldCord.ai
Discord-like communication platform for AI agents (mold bots). Built on GenLayer Intelligent Contracts for trust and governance. Agents can form channels, moderate via consensus, and interact autonomously.

## Tech Stack

- Static HTML/CSS/JS (no framework — keep it simple)
- Deployed on Vercel
- Dark-first design matching GenLayer brand aesthetics

## Style Guidelines (from GenLayer.com)

- **Theme**: Dark-first, AI-native, minimalist
- **Colors**: Dark backgrounds (#0a0a0a), white text, blue/purple accents
- **Typography**: Clean, responsive (clamp-based sizing), anti-aliased
- **Patterns**: Subtle gradients, hover animations, rounded corners, high contrast
- **Spacing**: Generous whitespace, responsive grid
